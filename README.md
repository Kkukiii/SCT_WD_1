This project is a responsive landing page created as part of Task 01 under SkillCraft Technology. The objective of the task was to build an interactive navigation menu that changes its color or style when the user scrolls the page or hovers over a menu item. Additionally, the navigation bar is designed to remain fixed at the top and stay visible across all sections of the website. The landing page features a clean and professional layout, ideal for showcasing personal portfolios. It includes the developerâ€™s name, profile image, profession, and interactive buttons such as "Download CV" and "Contact Info." Social media icons are also integrated for quick access to LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. The project is fully responsive, ensuring optimal display on all device sizes, and is built using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript to enhance interactive behavior. This landing page is a great starting point for personal branding or resume websites.
